# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CSS Bootstrap, started building the about page and tweaking the Navigation bar.

**Thoughts**: Bootstrap is a struggle with React, may change to React Bootstrap. Responsive navigation button not working will search for a solution.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
